# Kiva-Project-With-Seaborn
This project was adopted from the Codecademy Data Science course. I use the kiva_data.csv to create different data visualizations using the seaborn library. Answer a few questions using the different plots. To learn more about kiva, click the link in the jupyter notebook file.
